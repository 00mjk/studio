Version 0.12.3
===================

## General
- added tab setting awareness to editors (closes #1089)
- do not check the bitness of a GAMS system if no GAMS system was found before in order to avoid misleading error messages

## Search
- Find Next/Previous shortcut (Shift+)F3 now also works when result view is focussed
- remember search widget postion while studio is running (back to default on restart)

## Solver Option Editor
